# Scarlett-Speech-Recognition
Advanced Model>>>Still being worked on but quite efficient. Some of the code looks bizarre, but it actually improved recognition and reduced back noise interference. You are welcome to use this as a shell template, but don't copy my work. Be creative. My email is in the code if you ever have questions or you have a project you want help with.
