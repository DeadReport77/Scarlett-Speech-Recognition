# Scarlett Centuri AI-7-Speech-Recognition/SAFE FOR CONSUMER USE
Advanced Model---Still being worked on but quite efficient. Some of the code looks bizarre, but it actually improved recognition and reduced back noise interference. You are welcome to use this as a shell template, but don't copy my work. Be creative. My email is in the code if you ever have questions or you have a project you want help with.
I created my own sound files for her replies. The only time it slightly changes is when the date and time is displayed. The date call needs adjusting, it calls it as "long" with the forward slashes. I just haven't had time to adjust it. I had Scarlett's system scan hooked up to some batch files that examined Scarletts code, which are not included, so you will have to remove the "Process.Start" in the "Scanning Form." I have a lot more work to do on Scarlett as far as added features. Scarlett will serve home appliances as well when it's all said and done, along with her own Antivirus Program. 

NOTE: I stand by my work and I will always announce "safe programs" and the one's that are "dangerous" (as you can see in my repository).
Designing Malware and actually using it for malicious intent are two different fields. I design malware so that I can test programs that battle them.

                                                                                      Justin Linwood Ross (AKA Rythorian/Blackstar)
